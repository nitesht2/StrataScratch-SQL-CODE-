Gender With Generous Reviews
Write a query to find which gender gives a higher average review score when writing reviews as guests. Use the `from_type` column to identify guest reviews. Output the gender and their average review score.

SELECT g.gender,
        AVG(review_score) as avg_score
FROM airbnb_guests g
JOIN airbnb_reviews r
ON r.from_user = g.guest_id
WHERE from_type ='guest'
GROUP BY g.gender
ORDER BY avg_score DESC
LIMIT 1
